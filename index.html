<h2>Past Projects</h2>
<ul>
	<li><h3>Pseudo-Assembly Simulator with ANTLR (S E 319)</h3>
	  (This project in its entirety was devloped by myself, from inception to development to completion.)
		<br>Initially, this was assigned as our 3rd free-form portfolio assignment in S E 319 (Software Construction and User Interfaces). We had covered the ANTLR Lexer/Parser in class, albiet lightly. I decided to further explore ANTLR, and use what I was learning in COM S 321, (Introduction to Computer Architecture and Machine-Level Programming) namely the MIPS instruction set. The end result was a Lexer and Parser that could be run on a text file of MIPS instructions, and simulate the end results.
	<br>This project required good knowledge of Java, ANTLR Lexer/Parser rules, and Regular Expressions.
	<br>Resources Used: MIPS Reference (From COM S 321), ANLTR Reference (Provided in class)	
	<br>For a more in-depth analysis, see my <a href="docs/report319.pdf" target="_blank">written report</a>.
	</li>
	<li><h3>Roguelike Written in C++ (COM S 327)</h3>
	(The idea/requirements for this project were developed by the class, I carried out the development on my own.)
	<br>Over the course of the semester in COM S 327, (Advanced Programming Techniques) we were tasked with developing a roguelike using C, and C++ later on. Every week we were required to submit a (hopefully) working version that implemented the functionality specified. 10 separate versions were submitted over the course of the semester. The specific functionalities required good knowledge of C and C++, specifically knowledge of memory management, object-oriented design in C++, pre-processor commands, among many others.
	<br>Resources Used: Weekly Code Checkpoints (Provided in-class, each Checkpoint was the completed assignment from the previous week)	
	</li>
	<li><h3>Simulated Unix Shell using C (CPR E 308)</h3>
	(The idea/requirements for this project were developed by the class, I carried out the development on my own.)
	<br>Assigned as the first major programming project of CPR E 308, (Operating Systems: Principles and Practice) this project called for the creation of a Unix shell in C that provided most of the functionality of the baked-in shell. Specifically, the project focused on proper process creation, execution, and termination. The aspect of this project I found most difficult was in parsing through the command strings: I solved this by effectively building the argc and argv argument variables within my program, and tokenizing the string to fill the variables.
	<br>Resources Used: Unix and C documentation (i.e. man pages for various methods and functions)
	</li>
	<li><h3>IoT Network of Passive Sensors for Assisted Living Home (S E 491)</h3>
	See the Senior Design Section for more details.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Senior Design</h2>
(The idea/requirements for this project were developed by the client, I worked on this project along with 5 other S Es.)
<br>The main concept behind our Senior Design project is sensors to observe an elderly person's daily habits, and attempt to identify abnormal behavior that may indicate a health issue. My own focus was on figuring out communication between sensors and the Raspberry Pi's to which they were connected. Throughout the project, I created Weekly Status Reports and provided my feedback/ideas on design decisions, as well as assisting in troubleshooting various issues across the project domain.
